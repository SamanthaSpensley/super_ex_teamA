CHAPTER 1: ,I saw her at the coffee shop and wanted to go over and say hello. She had bright blue hair and was named Sabrina. I mustered up the courage to go over and introduce myself and reached out to shake hands saying, “Hello, pleasure to meet you I’m William,” smiling as I gave her my name while spastically spilling my latte all over her white summer dress.

CHAPTER 2:
She got a second degree burn and had to have the ambulance called.
She wanted my name and phone number for legal action purposes.
I gave her my best friend's contact information instead.

He thought "maybe I still have a chance... If I could be with this
girl, my life would be so great. It would be perfect!"

As the ambulance carted her away, he grabbed her crumpled up napkin and stuffed it into
his pocket. He would later remember her by the smell. Everynight, he
smelled it before bed and dreamed of that day when he saw her and immediately
fell in love.
